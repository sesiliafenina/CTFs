# CTFs

Hi guys! The main purpose of this repository is actually for me to document my CTF journey. (and maybe help out people who's trying to solve the same CTF challenges as me)

After doing several CTFs competitions, I realized how important it is to document my solutions, not only for the people who is learning to solve the CTF but also for my own personal documentation as I might need to revisit the CTFs that I've already solved in order to solve other similar CTFs.

So here we are!

I don't have a lot of CTFs documented here as I just started doing this documentation thing recently....

Hopefully this list will grow to 100++ files in the future!!
